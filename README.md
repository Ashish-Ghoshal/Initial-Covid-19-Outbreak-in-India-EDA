India has responded quickly, implementing a proactive, nationwide, lockdown, to flatten the curve and use the time to plan and resource responses adequately. As of 23rd May 2020, India has witnessed 3720 deaths from 32 States and Union Territories, with a total of 123202 confirmed cases due to COVID-19. Globally the Data Scientists are using AI and machine learning to analyze, predict, and take safety measures against COVID-19 in India. 

### Goal:
We need a explore the COVID situation in India and the world, and strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across India in the next 15 days.
###Tasks to be performed:
- Analyze the present condition in India
- Scrape out the COVID-19 from websites
- Figure out the death rate and cure rate per 100 across the affected states
- Create different charts to visualize the following: 
 - Age group distribution of affected patients
 - Total sample test done till date
 - Growth rate of COVID in top 15 states
 - Top 10 States in each health facility
 - State wise testing insight
- ICMR testing centres in each state
- Use Prophet to predict the confirmed cases in India
- Use ARIMA to predict the confirmed cases in India
- Compare the Indian COVID cases globally
